            <h1>Content</h1>
            <p><i> Let us show you why? Because of the Sri Lankan education system and the attitudes of parents,
                    children
                    are
                    pushed to follow the almost pre-defined path to obtain a degree qualification. Hence, all the higher
                    educational institutes including private and state universities are ready to offer a degree
                    qualification
                    for you after completing about 40 academic subjects. But, it is pretty obvious that there is a huge
                    gap
                    in
                    skills and knowledge of a student who has been just graduated in the IT field and the factual IT
                    industry
                    out there. Therefore, 90% of the degree holders are reluctant to enter into the IT industry or
                    rejected
                    by
                    the IT industry even they have been recognized by their degree qualifications.</i></p>
